# Laravel 12 Vue Starter Kit with Social Authentication

This project is a Laravel 12 application integrated with Vue.js using the new Vue Starter Kit. It includes social authentication using the Laravel Socialite package, allowing users to log in or sign up with various social providers. Users can also manage their connected social accounts from the dashboard settings.

## Features

- **Social Authentication**: Login and sign up using social providers (e.g., Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.).
- **Dashboard Settings**: Users can connect or disconnect social accounts from their profile settings.
- **Laravel 12**: Built with the latest version of Laravel.
- **Vue Starter Kit**: Integrated with Vue.js for a modern frontend experience.
- **Laravel Socialite**: Simplifies OAuth authentication with social providers.
- **Social Auth Management**: The `oauth_providers` table is used to manage social authentication providers. It includes the following columns:
  - `name`
  - `icon`
  - `client_id`
  - `client_secret`
  - `enabled`
  
  Use the `OauthProvidersSeeder` to easily add data for social providers.
